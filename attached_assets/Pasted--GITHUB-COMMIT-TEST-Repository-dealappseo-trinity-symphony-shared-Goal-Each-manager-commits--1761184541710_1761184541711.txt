## 🔍 WHAT WE'LL LEARN:

### **1. GitHub Access Verification:**
- ✅ All agents can authenticate
- ✅ All agents can push commits
- ✅ Repository permissions are correct

### **2. File Ownership Boundaries:**
- ✅ APM owns `/backend/apm/`
- ✅ HDM owns `/backend/hdm/`
- ✅ MEL/GCM owns `/frontend/` or `/ui/`
- ✅ Orchestrator owns `/orchestrator/core/`
- ✅ Shared files need coordination

### **3. Conflict Detection:**
- ❌ If two managers try to commit to same path → conflict
- ❌ If paths overlap → need clearer boundaries
- ❌ If permissions fail → need access fixes
