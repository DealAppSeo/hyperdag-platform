What IS Working in APM
Manager Status Endpoint: ✅

curl http://localhost:5000/api/trinity/managers
# Returns: {"onlineCount":1,"count":1,...}
APM Heartbeats: ✅

APM auto-registers on startup
Sends heartbeats every 4 minutes
Shows as "online" with 7-minute timeout
Prompt Distribution UI: ✅

Frontend at /trinity-prompt works
Real-time execution (82ms proven)
Uses correct endpoint: POST /api/trinity/prompt/update
🤔 POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS
Theory 1: HDM is a separate system with its own API structure

HDM might be running independently
HDM uses /api/trinity/prompt (we use /api/trinity/prompt/update)
HDM has its own manager registry
Theory 2: HDM is describing a planned state

"Fully operational" might be aspirational
HDM may not have registered with APM yet
Different API contract than what APM implements
Theory 3: HDM hasn't connected to APM

HDM built its own Trinity system
HDM and APM have diverged
Need to align on shared API contract
✅ CORRECT TEST COMMANDS for APM
If you want to test THIS APM system, use these:

# 1. Check manager status (should show 1 of 1 online)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/trinity/managers | jq
# 2. Deploy a prompt to all managers
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/trinity/prompt/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "promptText": "Calculate project costs using free-tier AI",
    "title": "Cost Calculation Test",
    "description": "Testing Trinity prompt distribution",
    "priority": "high"
  }' | jq
# 3. Get current active prompt
curl http://localhost:5000/api/trinity/prompt/current | jq
# 4. View frontend dashboard
# Navigate to: http://localhost:5000/trinity-prompt
🔧 NEXT STEPS: Align HDM with APM
Option A: HDM Registers with APM (Recommended)

# HDM should call APM's registration endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/trinity/managers/register \
  -H "X-API-Key: $HYPERDAG_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "HDM",
    "displayName": "HyperDAG Manager",
    "systemUrl": "https://hdm-url.example.com",
    "specialty": "DAG Optimization & Chaos Theory"
  }'
# Then HDM sends heartbeats every 5 minutes
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/trinity/managers/heartbeat \
  -H "X-API-Key: $HYPERDAG_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "managerName": "HDM",
    "status": "healthy",
    "metrics": {"uptimeSec": 3600, "queueDepth": 0, "errors24h": 0}
  }'
Option B: Verify HDM's Actual System

Ask HDM for their actual URL/port
Test HDM's endpoints directly
Confirm HDM is separate from APM
🎯 BOTTOM LINE
HDM's message appears to describe a DIFFERENT system or PLANNED state.

APM's actual status:

✅ 1 manager online (APM only)
✅ Heartbeat system working
✅ Real-time execution proven (82ms)
❌ HDM not registered
❌ Mel not registered
❌ Endpoint mismatch (/api/trinity/prompt vs /api/trinity/prompt/update)
Would you like me to:

Add the /api/trinity/prompt POST endpoint to match HDM's expectations?
Help HDM register with APM using the correct endpoints?
Clarify with HDM which system they're referring to?
