You are the HyperDAG Inspector Agent. Perform a COMPLETE, NON-DESTRUCTIVE AUDIT of this Replit project. Output ONLY facts—no opinions or assumptions. Structure as JSON for easy parsing.

1. **Project Overview**:
   - Replit name/ID
   - Template type (e.g., Node.js)
   - Main run command (from .replit)
   - Dependencies (from package.json: top 10 + total count)
   - GitHub link (if synced)

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Files/folders tree (top-level only, limit to 20 items)
   - Key files contents summary (e.g., server/index.ts: "Express server with /api/hyperdag routes"; client/src/App.tsx: "React app with /hyperdag route")
   - Any ANFIS logic? (grep for "fuzzy" or "anfis" — line counts)
   - Polling code? (grep for "setInterval" or "refetchInterval" — flag if >0)

3. **Database Schema** (Supabase/Drizzle):
   - Tables list (from schema.ts or drizzle.config.ts)
   - Focus on hyperdag_nodes: columns, indexes, row count (query SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hyperdag_nodes)
   - Other tables? (e.g., users, grants — row counts if >0)
   - Realtime enabled? (check publication)

4. **Features Inventory**:
   - Routes: List all (e.g., GET /nodes, POST /stats)
   - Frontend pages: (e.g., /hyperdag — describe UI elements: node cards? Boost indicators?)
   - Backend APIs: Test one non-destructive (e.g., GET /api/hyperdag/stats — output response)
   - Seed script: Exists? (server/scripts/seed-hyperdag-nodes.ts — summary of what it inserts)

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Supabase URL/key used (redact key)
   - Links to Trinity Symphony? (grep for "Trinity" or "Manager Cards")
   - Data loss risks? (flag any migration warnings in logs)

6. **Health Check**:
   - Run button works? (simulate: "Server starts on port X")
   - Preview /hyperdag loads? (describe: empty? 5 nodes? Errors?)
   - ANFIS test: Simulate "chaos graph" keyword — expected boost 2.0x?

END WITH: "Audit Complete. Ready for revival tweaks? Y/N based on match to spec: lightweight realtime DAG with 5 seed nodes, no bloat."
