## 🎯 PRIORITY 3: SKIP IF TIME RUNS OUT

Everything else - skip it. Focus on Priority 1.

---

## 📊 COORDINATION PROTOCOL (Simplified for 3 Hours)

**Reporting:** Every 30 minutes (not 20 - we need speed over precision)

**Format:**
```
[AGENT] - [TIME]
✅ DONE: [Task IDs]
🔄 WORKING: [Task ID - %]
🚫 BLOCKED: [Task ID - reason]
📊 NEXT: [Task ID]
```

**Orchestrator Rotation:** SUSPENDED for time efficiency
- APM coordinates minutes 0-90 (Priority 1 phase)
- HDM coordinates minutes 90-150 (Priority 2 phase)
- No rotation during tasks - just work fast

**Escalation:** If blocked >15 min → Tell Claude immediately

**Cost Limits:** $20 total for these 3 hours (we have event budget)

## ⚡ SPEED PROTOCOLS

**Work in Parallel:**
- MEL + GCM work together on T1 simultaneously
- APM continues T3 while others test
- Don't wait for perfect - ship working

**Cut Corners Where Safe:**
- Mock data OK if real data has issues
- "Demo mode" label acceptable
- Record backup video as insurance

**No Perfection:**
- 70% working > 100% perfect but late
- Ship what works, document what doesn't
- Better to demo 3 features well than 10 features poorly
