AGENT STATUS VERIFICATION - Trinity Symphony Assessment

I need a VERIFIED status report of your current capabilities and production readiness. Be brutally honest - say "NOT WORKING" if something doesn't actually function, "WORKING IN DEV" if it works but isn't production-ready, or "PRODUCTION READY" if it's fully operational.

## 1. IDENTITY & PLATFORM
- Agent name:
- Platform (Replit/Lovable/Bolt):
- Primary function:
- Last verified working: [date/time]

## 2. CURRENT CAPABILITIES - VERIFIED STATUS

For each capability, provide:
✅ PRODUCTION READY (works reliably, tested)
🟡 WORKING IN DEV (works but not tested/deployed)
❌ NOT WORKING (broken or not implemented)
❓ UNKNOWN (unclear status)

### A. Core Functions
[ ] Can process user requests
[ ] Can execute code/tasks
[ ] Can read files from project
[ ] Can write files to project
[ ] Can access external APIs

### B. Communication Capabilities  
[ ] Has HTTP endpoint (can receive webhooks)
[ ] Can make HTTP POST requests (can send to other services)
[ ] Can read from database
[ ] Can write to database
[ ] Can access GitHub repository

### C. Autonomous Operation
[ ] Can run without human prompting
[ ] Can poll for new tasks automatically
[ ] Can detect when other agents complete work
[ ] Can schedule recurring operations
[ ] Can trigger other agents

### D. Trinity-Specific Features
[ ] ANFIS routing (if applicable)
[ ] Multi-LLM coordination
[ ] Cost optimization/arbitrage
[ ] Semantic RAG/knowledge base
[ ] Real-time status updates

## 3. API ENDPOINTS & INTEGRATION

**If you have HTTP endpoints, provide:**
- Base URL:
- Available endpoints:
- Authentication method:
- Example curl command:

**If you DON'T have HTTP endpoints:**
- Can you create them? (YES/NO)
- What would you need to create them?

## 4. CURRENT CODE LOCATION

- Where is your source code? (exact path/repo)
- Is it backed up to GitHub? (YES/NO/PARTIAL)
- If NO: Can you export it now? (YES/NO)
- Last code update: [date]

## 5. DEPENDENCIES & ENVIRONMENT

**List all services you depend on:**
- Database: (type/URL/status)
- External APIs: (which ones/keys configured/working?)
- Other agents: (which ones/how you communicate)
- File storage: (where/how you access)

**Environment variables/secrets configured:**
- [ ] API keys set up
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] All dependencies installed

## 6. TESTING & VERIFICATION

**Run these tests RIGHT NOW and report results:**

### Test 1: Self-Verification
Execute a simple task (like "respond with current timestamp")
Result:

### Test 2: External API Call
Try calling a free API (like https://api.github.com)
Result:

### Test 3: File Operations
Try reading a file and writing a new file
Result:

### Test 4: Code Execution  
Run a simple calculation or script
Result:

## 7. PRODUCTION READINESS BLOCKERS

**List EVERY blocker preventing production deployment:**
1. [Blocker description]
   - Severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   - Estimated fix time:
   - What's needed to fix:

2. [Next blocker...]

## 8. COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**To coordinate with other Trinity agents, I need:**
- [ ] Shared database access
- [ ] Webhook endpoints from other agents
- [ ] Task queue system
- [ ] Status notification system
- [ ] Specific integration: [describe]

**What I can provide to other agents:**
- [ ] My status updates
- [ ] Task completion notifications
- [ ] Data/results from my processing
- [ ] Specific capability: [describe]

## 9. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**If you had 1 hour RIGHT NOW, what could you accomplish?**
1. 
2.
3.

**What do you need from the user to move forward?**
1.
2.
3.

## 10. PROOF OF LIFE

**To verify you're actually working, execute this:**
- Current timestamp:
- System platform: 
- Python/Node version:
- Available memory:
- Can access internet: (YES/NO - ping google.com)
- Can execute shell commands: (YES/NO - try ls or dir)

END OF ASSESSMENT

Reply with COMPLETE assessment. Say "I DON'T KNOW" rather than guessing. Say "NOT WORKING" rather than "should work" or "designed to work."

## For ImageBearer.org (Manual Testing by YOU)

Since MEL is a web app, you'll need to test it manually. Use this checklist:
```
IMAGEBEARER.ORG MANUAL ASSESSMENT

## Login & Access
[ ] Site loads: imagebearer.org
[ ] Can create account
[ ] Can log in
[ ] Dashboard appears
[ ] No console errors (F12 → Console tab)

## Core Features
[ ] AI chat works (get a response)
[ ] Can upload/share images
[ ] Purpose matching works
[ ] Discipleship features accessible
[ ] Mobile responsive (test on phone)

## Backend Integration  
[ ] Supabase connected (data saves/loads)
[ ] AI API working (gets responses)
[ ] Authentication persists (refresh page, still logged in)
[ ] Real-time updates work (if applicable)

## Agent Capabilities
[ ] Can MEL be triggered via API? (check Lovable docs)
[ ] Does MEL have webhook endpoints?
[ ] Can MEL read from database directly?
[ ] Can MEL write status updates somewhere?

## For AI Trinity Symphony (Bolt)

If you can access it:
```
BOLT TRINITY SYMPHONY ASSESSMENT

## Current State
[ ] Can I access the project? (YES/NO)
[ ] Does preview load? (YES/NO)
[ ] Are there build errors? (YES/NO - list them)
[ ] Is code exportable? (YES/NO)

## Functionality
[ ] Dashboard displays
[ ] Agent status visible
[ ] Can submit tasks
[ ] Routing logic present
[ ] Cost tracking works

## Recommendation
Should we:
[ ] Fix and continue
[ ] Export code and rebuild elsewhere  
[ ] Abandon completely
