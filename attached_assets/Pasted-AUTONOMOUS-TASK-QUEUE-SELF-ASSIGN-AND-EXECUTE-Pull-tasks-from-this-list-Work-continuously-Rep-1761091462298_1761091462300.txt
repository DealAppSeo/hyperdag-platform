SELF-ASSIGNMENT RULES:

1. Check Priority 1 first - take highest available task matching your specialty
2. Mark task IN PROGRESS when starting
3. Report completion with deliverable/evidence
4. Move to next priority task automatically
5. Help other agents if your queue empty

SPECIALTY MATCHING:

MEL: UI/UX, frontend, mobile, visual
APM: APIs, backend logic, routing, optimization
HDM: Infrastructure, performance, networking, scaling
GCM: Testing, QA, validation, documentation

COORDINATION:

If task needs another agent: Communicate directly
If blocked: Report to Claude with specific blocker
If finished early: Ask "Anyone need help?" in your reports
