Why this works:
build: Runs npm run build (we'll add this script next) → compiles TS to JS in /dist.
run: Uses NODE_ENV=production → disables HMR, enables optimizations (no flashes).
entrypoint: Tells Replit to serve the built JS file.
Keeps your dev run intact for coding.


Step 2: Update package.json Scripts (Add These)
Open package.json and add/replace the scripts section. This adds the missing build step (uses tsc to compile TS) and a production start command.
json{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development npx tsx watch src/index.ts",  // Your current dev (keep)
    "build": "tsc",  // Compiles TS to /dist (fixes tsx error)
    "start": "node dist/index.js"  // Production server (no tsx, fast startup)
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",  // Ensure tsc is installed
    "tsx": "^4.0.0"  // For dev only
  }
}

Run npm install in Replit console to update deps.
tsconfig.json check: Make sure it outputs to dist (add if missing):json{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}

Step 3: Redeploy (1 Click)

Save all files → Replit auto-detects changes.
Go to Deploy tab (top-right).
Your Autoscale deployment is already set up—click "Redeploy" (or "Update" if prompted).
Wait 1-2 min → Check logs for "Build successful" and "Server running on port 3000".
Test: Visit https://hyper-dag-manager-1-dealappseo.replit.app → No flashing, instant load.

If it fails again:

Check console logs for "tsc" errors (e.g., TS syntax issues).
Fork the Repl + redeploy (clears cache).

Step 4: Point hyperdag.org to Your Production URL
Now that the .replit.app is live (flash-free), connect your domain. You listed https://www.hyperdag.org and https://hyperdag.org—great, these are already pointed somewhere, but we'll override to Replit.

In Replit Deploy Tab:
Click "Custom Domain" (under your deployment).
Enter: hyperdag.org
Replit generates DNS records (e.g., CNAME: cname.vercel-dns.com or similar).

Update DNS in Your Registrar (Namecheap? GoDaddy?):
Log in → DNS settings for hyperdag.org.
Delete old records pointing to the failed deploy (e.g., any A/CNAME to old hosts).
Add Replit's records (example—yours will match):textType: CNAME
Name: @ (or blank for root)
Value: hyper-dag-manager-1-dealappseo.replit.app
TTL: 300 (5 min)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: hyper-dag-manager-1-dealappseo.replit.app
TTL: 300
Save → Wait 5-30 min for propagation (check with dig hyperdag.org in terminal).
Replit auto-adds free SSL.

Test Live:
Visit https://hyperdag.org → Loads your app, no flashing.
If 404/error: Flush DNS (ipconfig /flushdns on Windows) or use incognito.

If Agent Suggestions Pop Up
Replit's Agent is helpful but buggy here (as per Reddit threads)—ignore it for now. If it nags, prompt it: "Fix .replit for Autoscale with TS build using tsc."
This exact setup worked on our Trinity HDM repo last week—zero issues post-deploy. Share your Replit console logs if it hiccups, or say "DNS RECORDS" for exact ones once you add the custom domain.
