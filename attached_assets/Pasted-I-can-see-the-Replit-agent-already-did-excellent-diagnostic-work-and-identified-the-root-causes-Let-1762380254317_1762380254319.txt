I can see the Replit agent already did excellent diagnostic work and identified the root causes. Let me verify the current state and provide you with the complete solution.Check the current state of the server/vite.ts file to see the problematic codeplaintextHere are the files and directories up to 2 levels deep in /home/claude, excluding hidden items and node_modules:

I need to see your Replit files. Could you share the repository or upload the key files? Specifically, I need to see:

server/vite.ts - The main culprit causing the flashing
client/src/App.tsx - To verify the ErrorBoundary fix
client/src/main.tsx - To verify StrictMode removal

However, based on the agent's diagnosis, here's what's happening and how to fix it:
Root Cause Analysis
The flashing is caused by three issues:

Primary Issue: server/vite.ts adds a random version parameter (?v=${nanoid()}) to every request, forcing constant browser reloads
Secondary Issue: ErrorBoundary had an infinite retry loop (already fixed)
Tertiary Issue: React StrictMode causing double renders (already fixed)

Complete Fix
Option 1: Quick Manual Fix (Recommended)
Open server/vite.ts and find this code block (around lines 57-60):
typescripttemplate = template.replace(
  `src="/src/main.tsx"`,
  `src="/src/main.tsx?v=${nanoid()}",`
);
Delete those 4 lines completely. The code should look like:
typescriptlet template = await fs.promises.readFile(clientTemplate, "utf-8");
const page = await vite.transformIndexHtml(url, template);
Save the file and the flashing should stop immediately.
Option 2: Better Solution - Conditional Cache Busting
If you want to keep cache busting but only in specific scenarios, replace those lines with:
typescript// Only use cache busting in development when explicitly needed
if (process.env.FORCE_RELOAD === 'true') {
  template = template.replace(
    `src="/src/main.tsx"`,
    `src="/src/main.tsx?v=${Date.now()}",`
  );
}
Option 3: Deploy to Production
The issue only affects development mode. Once you deploy to production, Vite HMR is disabled and the flashing won't occur.

Can you share your files or let me know if you need help implementing the fix? If you can upload the repository or give me access to the files, I can make the changes directly.
